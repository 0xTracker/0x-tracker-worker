# This file introduces a script into the Elasticbeanstalk deployment process
# which installs modules via npm ci instead of using the default NPM install.

# Because 50npm.sh also installs Node, we need to install Node ourselves in this script.

      # Prevent installing or rebuilding like Elastic Beanstalk tries to do by
      # default.

      # Note that this *overwrites* Elastic Beanstalk's default 50npm.sh script.
      # But their default script actually doesn't work at all, since the app
      # staging dir, where they try to run `npm install`, doesn't exist during
      # config deploys, so ebnode.py just aborts:
